# Template

This is a simple template for a Rust project using the [Zed](https://zed.dev/) editor and [development containers](https://containers.dev/) and the [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/) CLI to manage it all.

## Getting Started

1. Install the [DevPod CLI](https://devpod.sh/docs/getting-started/install#install-devpod-cli).
2. Copy this repository and file off the serial numbers

## Development

```bash
cd /path/to/template

# Build the container, bring it up, and open the editor
devpod up .
```

When you're done, you can stop the container with `devpod down`.
